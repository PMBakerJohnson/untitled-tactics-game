Okay so, we have a general plot structure and central narrative for what is now called Project Sweet Home, about how society passively tries to construct, protect, and coerce an idea of normalcy that isn't representative necessarily of how anything actually is, or anything that is actually helpful to the well being of the people living within it

Central plot is that the main characters live in a small midwestern town because we're writing what we know I guess and are approached to work with The Contractor who is completely undefined so far. The Contractor gives them magical power in exchange for them fighting magical beasties to help clear space for The Contractor to develop into, expanding on the town and improving the general quality of life there. Eventually, the protagonists meet The Bigfoot who is not a literal Bigfoot but rather is some other recognizable and preferably particularly weird cryptid, and The Bigfoot offers them a different approach to the situation that reveals what is being lost, and what is really being gained through the Contractor's efforts
The protagonists turn on the Contractor, and from that point forward are fighting against the Contractor's agents, and denied the town and thus the ability to rest and be passive
Then they punch The Contractor to death or something
It's a rough first take
