I'm going to create a tactics game! I'm thinking, tentatively, magical girls, trauma, conflict, and how those last two change us (or more specifically magical girls). Heavy characterization focus, and light narrative focus.

-- First, I need a story. A concrete one! I want a nice good story outline. No half asses, or quarter asses, etc etc.
